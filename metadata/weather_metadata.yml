    definition: >
      This data element records the prevailing atmospheric conditions that existed at the time of the
      crash as indicated in the case material
    notes: >
      Prior to 2020 this data element identified up to two values. If more than two atmospheric
      conditions were reported, the two conditions that most affect visibility were selected.
      Accident.WEATHER1 and Accident.WEATHER2 were the coded data elements, and
      Accident.WEATHER was derived from these two. The two coded data elements were
      discontinued after 2019 and moved to the Discontinued Accident Data Elements at the end of the
      Accident Data File section.
      Beginning in 2020 all applicable atmospheric conditions are selected and stored in this data file.
      Only the derived data element WEATHER is still stored in the Accident data file and is now
      derived from the responses in this data file using the same hierarchy
